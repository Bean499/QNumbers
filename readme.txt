How to Use the New Q Numbers Database

The new Q Numbers Database is not in Excel, thus any amount of people can view and ammend Q Numbers at the same time.
To use, open the internet shortcut named "!QNumbers". This will take you to the front page for making new Q Numbers.
Use the navigation bar at the top to visit sub pages, which allow you to edit Q Numbers, view them in table form, or
add extra details to a sub table for RFQ, CN, RU, and 8D Q Numbers, replacing the extra sheets in the Excel document.

FAQ:

Are all of this year's Q Numbers already in the database?
Yes, all the data has already been imported.

The table is too big. How can I find specific Q Numbers?
Go to the "Search Q Numbers" page. Here you can enter a part number, drawing number, or a pair of dates to find them by.

How can I put the database's information into an Excel spreadsheet for meetings?
This process is slightly complicated, but here's how:
	1. Open the internet shortcut called "!PHPMyAdmin". This takes you to the control panel for the database.
	2. Click on the "Export" button.
	3. Choose "CSV for MS Excel" in the drop down box labelled "Format", and click "Go". This will download
	   a .CSV file.
	4. Open Microsoft Excel and make a new spreadsheet.
	5. Go to the "Data" tab and click "From Text/CSV". Then open the .CSV file you just downloaded.

How do I know what the Q Number is of the Q Number I just made?
When you make a Q Number, a popup window will appear, showing the Q Number. You can also check the table.

How do I view the sub tables for RFQ, CN, RU, or 8D Reports?
If you go to the respective sub page, there will be a link to the table.

There's a page for editing Q Numbers, but not the extra info of RFQ, CN, RU and 8D Reports. How can I do that?
The page used to create entries for those sub types also acts as an editing page. Any existing information will be
automatically filled in, and you can ammend it as you wish.
