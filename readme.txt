Q Numbers Database & Interface by Ben Robinson

Things to do Before Using:
1.  Open "newQNumber.php" using Notepad or another text editor. Go to line 87. 
    Replace the text qnumbers with the directory you wish Q Number folders to 
    be made in (ensure not to get rid of the forward slash after qnumbers). As
    an example, the line should like something like this when done:

    $directory = "C:/Thermex/Documents/QNumbers/".$year."/".$hundred."/"."/".$QNumber;

2.  Open sql.txt and copy the contents into an SQL console. Running this will
    create the database's tables.
